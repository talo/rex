//! Hindley-Milner type system with parametric polymorphism, type classes, and ADTs.
//! The goal is to provide a reusable library for building typing environments for Rex.
//! Features:
//! - Type variables, type constructors, function and tuple types.
//! - Schemes with quantified variables and class constraints.
//! - Type classes with superclass relationships and instance resolution.
//! - Basic ADTs (List, Result, Option) and numeric/string primitives in the prelude.
//! - Utilities to register additional function/type declarations (e.g. `(-)`, `(/)`).
