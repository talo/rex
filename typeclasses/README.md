Rust implementation of code from the paper [Typing Haskell in
Haskell](https://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~mpj/thih/thih.pdf) by Mark P. Jones. The
purpose of our Rust version is to get a working implementation of the algorithm
which we can subsequently integrate into `rex-type-system`.

The `haskell` directory contains the code from `thih-Nov23-2000.zip` obtained
from the article's site ([archived
copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20050505064704/http://www.cse.ogi.edu/~mpj/thih/)).
